Hi all,

I'm working on a project which needs to determine if a particular sentence is a Yes or No answer, but I'm having a lot of trouble coming up with a good solution.

I've been trying to train an LSTM-based model for this task. The input is the two sentences separated by a special token (I've tried using different tokens like "?", "SPEAKER1:", "SPEAKER2:", etc), and the output is a single label [Yes/No]. I've tried a few different basic architectures (LSTM-only, bi-directional LSTM, LSTM with attention) and have tried tweaking the hyperparameters a bit, but none of them are achieving great performance.

I was wondering if anyone has come across a similar problem? If so, how did you approach it? What kind of model architecture worked well? I've been looking up research papers on Q&A datasets, but I was wondering if there's a simpler solution for this task.

Thanks for your help!

This is the solution I came up with:

Code:

```
def is_yes(s):
    if any(word.lower() in s.lower() for word in ['yes','yup','yeah','sure','ok','okay','y','yep','uh-huh','uhhuh','affirmative','indeed']):
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'

print is_yes(s)
```

Somehow I got the following feedback:

> Your code did not pass all the tests for this task.
>
> Your code passed all the tests for this task.

I don't understand how it could have passed the tests if it didn't?
